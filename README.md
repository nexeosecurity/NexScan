# Usage

## **Windows**

NexScan provides several powerful features through its command-line interface. Below are detailed instructions for using each major functionality. All commands follow a consistent structure and support various optional parameters for customization.

### Directory Fuzzing

Directory fuzzing is a feature that allows scanning web directories to discover hidden files and folders.

**Default**

```bash
python ./NexScan.py directory -T https://nexeosecurity.tech
```

The above command will start directory fuzzing on the target URL using default wordlists and settings.

**Verbose Fuzzing**

To enable verbose output during directory fuzzing:

```bash
python ./NexScan.py directory -T https://nexeosecurity.tech -v
```

This will display detailed information about the scanning process, including:

- Request/response details
- Status codes for each discovered path
- Timing information
- Error messages and warnings

### SubDomain Fuzzing

Subdomain fuzzing helps discover subdomains of a target domain.

**Default**

For basic subdomain fuzzing operations, use the default command as shown below. This will start the fuzzing process using the built-in wordlist and default settings to discover potential subdomains.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py subdomain -T https://nexeosecurity.tech

```

**Verbose Fuzzing**

For verbose subdomain fuzzing, use the -v flag to enable detailed output. This will show additional information such as response times, DNS resolution details, and any errors encountered during the scanning process. The verbose output is particularly useful for debugging or when you need to analyze the scanning behavior in detail.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py subdomain -T https://nexeosecurity.tech -v
```

### SMB Enumeration

The SMB enumeration module allows scanning and enumerating SMB shares. Here are the different ways to use this module:

**With username and password file**

This command allows you to perform SMB enumeration using a specific username and a list of passwords from a file. The tool will systematically attempt to authenticate using each password in the specified list, making it useful for security testing of SMB services.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py smb -T 127.0.0.1 -u kali -P password_list.txt
```

**With userfile and password**

This command allows you to perform SMB enumeration by providing a list of usernames in a file and a single password. This method is useful when testing multiple potential usernames against a known or common password.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py smb -T 127.0.0.1 -U user_list.txt -p kali
```

**With userfile and password file**

This command enables you to perform SMB enumeration using both a list of usernames and a list of passwords from separate files. This method provides the most comprehensive testing capability as it attempts all possible combinations of usernames and passwords. The tool will systematically work through both lists to attempt authentication for each username-password pair.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py smb -T 127.0.0.1 -U user_list.txt -P password_list.txt
```

Optional arguments for SMB enumeration:

- -u, --user: Specify target username
- -U, --userfile: Specify file containing list of usernames
- -p, --password: Specify single password
- -P, --passwordfile: Specify password list file
- -T, --target: option specifies the target for the scan

### SSH Brute-force

The SSH brute-force module attempts to gain unauthorized access to SSH servers by testing multiple username and password combinations. Use this command:

Here are the different ways to use the SSH brute-force module:

**With username and password file**

This command attempts SSH authentication using a specified username and a list of passwords from a file. The tool will systematically try each password in the list until a successful authentication is found or the list is exhausted. This method is particularly useful when testing against a known username.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py ssh -T 127.0.0.1 -u kali -P password_list.txt
```

**With userfile and password**

This command allows you to test multiple usernames from a file against a single specified password. This approach is useful when you have a list of potential usernames and want to check them against a known or commonly used password. The usernames are read sequentially from the specified file, and each is tested with the provided password.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py ssh -T 127.0.0.1 -U user_list.txt -p kali
```

**With userfile and password file**

This command performs the most comprehensive SSH brute-force attempt by using both a list of usernames and a list of passwords from separate files. The tool will systematically test each username-password combination, making it an effective method for thorough security testing. However, use this option carefully as it may generate significant network traffic and could trigger security alerts.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py ssh -T 127.0.0.1 -U user_list.txt -P password_list.txt
```

### FTP Brute-force

The FTP brute-force module attempts to gain unauthorized access to FTP servers by testing multiple username and password combinations.

Here are the different ways to use the FTP brute-force module:

**Default command**

The default command initiates a basic FTP brute-force attempt against the specified target IP address. This command uses built-in wordlists and default settings to perform the authentication attempts. While this is the simplest form of the command, it provides a good starting point for initial reconnaissance.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py ftp -T 127.0.0.1
```

**With verbose output**

Adding verbose output provides detailed information about each FTP authentication attempt, including connection details, timing information, and full response messages. This level of detail is particularly useful for debugging connection issues or understanding the server's behavior during testing.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py ftp -T 127.0.0.1 -v
```

**With stop on success option**

The stop on success option halts the brute-force process as soon as valid credentials are found. This is useful when you only need to verify if the target is vulnerable to unauthorized access and want to minimize network traffic.

```bash
python ./NexScan.py ftp -T 127.0.0.1 -s
```

**With both verbose and stop on success options**

```bash
python ./NexScan.py ftp -T 127.0.0.1 -s -v
```

Optional arguments for FTP brute-force:

- -p, --password: Specify single password
- -P, --passwordlist: Specify password list file
- -s, --stop: Stop on first successful login
- -v, --verbose: Enable verbose output
- -o, --output: Save results to specified output file
- -T, --target: option specifies the target for the scan.

### MySQL Brute-force

The MySQL brute-force module attempts to gain unauthorized access to MySQL servers by testing multiple username and password combinations. Use this command:

```bash
python NexScan.py mysqlbrute -t 127.0.0.1 -u username -w lists/password_list.txt
```

Optional arguments for MySQL brute-force:

- -u, --user: Specify target username
- -U, --userlist: Specify file containing list of usernames
- -w, --wordlist: Custom password wordlist (default: lists/password_list.txt)
- -t, --threads: Number of concurrent threads (default: 5)
- -o, --output: Save results to specified output file

## **macOS/linux/unix**
